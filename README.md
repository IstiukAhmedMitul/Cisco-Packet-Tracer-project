📘 Subnetting & Cisco Packet Tracer Project
🔷 Overview

This repository contains solutions to three subnetting problems, each solved using:

VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking)

Manual subnet calculations

Routing table design

Cisco Packet Tracer network implementation

Each problem is documented thoroughly in a Word file, and the working network topology is provided in a Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) file.

This project is useful for:

Students studying subnetting

Networking labs

CCNA preparation

Anyone learning routing, IP addressing, and Packet Tracer network design
